# Innovenso Townplanner

The Innovenso Townplanner is a set of libraries used to document a town plan.

## Enterprise Architecture As Code

The Townplanner allows you to document the entire enterprise architecture of a company, using an easy to understand
Domain Specific Language (DSL).

## I love it when a town plan comes together

A craftsman makes his own tools. So, as a software craftsman, when I entered the field of Enterprise Achitecture, it
was inevitable for me to create my EA tool. First I have tried many existing ones, like Sparx, Archi, Mega and Structurizr (although that last one is not really an EA tool),
but I found most of them horrible to use, so eventually I did what everyone does, I reverted to Excel and a simple diagramming tool.

Of course, after doing the same thing a few times, I wanted to automate a few things, so I wrote a little application that
generated diagrams and documents from my Excel sheet. Soon I added things like AWS account scanning, a UI, technology radar
rendering, Confluence and Miro export and Archimate export.

In its current version, the Innovenso Townplanner is based around an extensible model with a Domain Specific Language,
and a number of export and import capabilities, which will grow over time as I need them. I do believe other enterprise
architects who still like to code a bit will be able to benefit from it already, so I decided to release it as an
open-source project.

Enjoy!
